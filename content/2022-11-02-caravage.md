    pains:
      - The public is very diverse and there is no specific target audience.
      - People usually don't stop in front of paintings.
      - WIFI in the museum is very terrible
    solutions:
      - The project has to be accessible in every way and very user friendly.
      - If the game is engaging and uses a painting the player will recall the painting.
      - The project has to be optimised in order to work in every circumpstance.
