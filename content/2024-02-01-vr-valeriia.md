    pains:
      - Emotional project that should imprint our message but not exploit Valeriia's pain
      - Never tried VR using Unity + very short project
      - VR can induse motion sickness due to UX, performance and eye sensitivities
    solutions:
      - "Let Valeriia tell her story, and let her approve & narate the experience."
      - Focused a whole day on documentation and question more experience peers.
      - Static scenes <only 360Â°> + optimize models to keep frame rate above 60fps

        - text: "We interviewed Valeriia. She told us a story that focused on the fear she felt one night for her and her kid, during her journey. We chose the theme of light and darkness. The light of the headlight she saw in the night, the darkness of war and fear and the light of hope."

        - text: "We finally created a physical installation for the actual exhibition. With big cubes we surrounded the visitor to isolate them and mimic the debris of a bombed city and colored them in bright yellow and black to show our light and darkness message."
