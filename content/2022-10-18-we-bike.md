    pains:
      - Very little visibility of the app, very tricky user experience
      - Electrical bikes unusable because never explained
      - Rigid and tedious reservation process
      - A lot of bad experiences with bikes
    solutions:
      - Creation of a new user flow 
      - A 'How to use' page for regular and electrical bike
      - Add a feature to reserve for multiple people and from your phone
      - Add a rating system for the bikes
