problematic: "The MMI Wrokshops are a 3 weeks-long hackathon that mixes all the students. The rules are : develop a concept through a site or an app and/or social media, that responds to an important SOCIAL or SOCIETAL issue. The project has to be innovating (never done before), scalable, useful and self-maintaining. This second year we chose to create a web novel for highschoolers for the association 'Les Orchid√©es Rouges' (LOR) who fight against EXCISION or FGM (Female Genital Mutilation)."

    pains:
      - Talk about an extremly sensitive topic to a young audience.
      - Be aware of hurtful stereotypes & assumptions
      - Sharing traumatic stories that we didn't live ourselves.
      - Treat a large issue way bigger than us.
      - Work with a busy association.
      - Keep hope
    solutions:
      - Simple yet impactful tone and assets <not too violent> to connect with people.
      - Share different true stories <varying ethnicities, religion, backgrounds>
      - Not possible to talk to the victims. We used public anonymous testimonials.
      - Keep a humble posture. <We won't be able to convince excisers to stop.>
      - Organise weekly updates and daily emails to keep them informed <& envolved>.
      - Tell healing journeys.

        - text: We started by documenting ourselves and see existing web novel to get references. We got inspired by comic books like Persepolis or The Waltz with Bashir. We then started to write 3 scenarii <will decrease to 2>.

        - text: "We digitalised and stylised our sketches. Only 3 colors to convey our stories : black, white and red. We kept the line clean and minimalistic for the stories and cloudy and faded for the dreams or the memories of the girl."
