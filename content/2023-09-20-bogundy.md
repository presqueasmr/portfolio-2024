      - Oriental definition of a good UI is different from an occidental one
      - The site is targeting a very wealthy crowd interested in collections.
      - Need for sponsorship to access the app
    solutions:
      - Chinese people use 'mega-apps' & QR codes = Create mobile-first website.
      - Chinese UI is usually more cluttered. <More informations = more quality>.
      - Insist on the quality of the wine & its french origin. Promote a savoir-faire
      - Use of QR codes and sponsorhip incentives.
