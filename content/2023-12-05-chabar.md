    pains:
      - The brand has to be memorable.
      - Tea is usually seen as calming <or boring> and less of a morning to-go beverage.
      - The brand is not for recreative drinking such as bubble tea.
    solutions:
      - Let's opt for pastel colors and cool 'serigraphied' big geographic shapes
      - Play into the calming vibes and insisting on the health & chinese traditions
      - Target an older audience that's looking for a healthy alternative for coffee

          - Creating a new brand and logo
          - Developping a message around a pitch and translate it into a visual universe
          - I could have simplified the logo in order to decline it smoothly
