problematic: "On the occasion of the 'Nuit Européenne des musées', the MUSBA and MMI decided to collaborate once again ! Our mission as MMI student was to create a full interface on a very large touch table. Divided in 6 groupes and a QA group, we had to create 5 different educational interactive experiences. We created the game 'Papa's Vanitas'."

    pains:
      - The touch table is very large and is not device we are used to work on.
      - Our interactive ingredients have a double action <touch + drag>.
      - Keep in mind that the main target audience is  older. 
      - Work with 50 people and still keep a unity throughout the experiences.
    solutions:
      - Test on the actual device.
      - <TEST! TEST! TEST!> Make unbiased users try each iteration of our design.
      - Refer to games usually played by elders <like Candy Crush>.
      - A common design system for global interactions <sound, homepage...>.

  learningSection:
            - Working with 50 people on one and only project
            - Designing and developing on an unusual device (taking into account this constraint or chance...)
            - Never be certain of the quality of the UX/game design preventively and always test each iteration (be humble)
