problematic: "The MMI Wrokshops are a 3 weeks-long hackathon that mixes all the students. The rules are : develop a concept through a site or an app and/or social media, that responds to an important SOCIAL or SOCIETAL issue. The project has to be innovating (never done before), scalable, useful and self-maintaining. We chose the subject of ENDOMETRIOSIS"

    pains:
      - 10% of women suffer from endometriosis / takes on average 7 years to diagnose
      - No existing device targeting young people about the issue (+taboo)
      - Health is a very sensitive subject especially when talking to young people
    solutions:
      - Creating a website to inform, sensitize and share endometriosis stories 
      - Using a friendly tone & drawings / share the site with middle and highschools
      - Sharing real stories from interviews / getting the content approved by a doctor
